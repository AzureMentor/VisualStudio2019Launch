# Visual Studio 2019 Launch Syndication 
## April 2, 2019, 9:00am – 4:00pm Pacific Time (UTC-7) 
### Live stream embed instructions for webmasters 
  
The Visual Studio 2019 Launch will broadcast from Microsoft studios. You can syndicate the broadcast on your own developer-focused sites. Please contact [vs2019launch@microsoft.com](mailto:vs2019launch@microsoft.com) and let us know! 
  
This document contains embed information for the Visual Studio 2019 Launch live streaming player. Sites can easily embed the webcast by inserting the iframe code snippet below. The provided player will be activated with slate and music within 60 minutes of the event’s scheduled start time and transition to on-demand within 10 minutes of the broadcast’s conclusion.   
  
### How to and best practices  
To stream the event live, place the iframe code snippet provided below onto your site where you would like the player to appear. The feed will be broadcast in 720p format and provide the option for end users to enable English captions.

Please test the embedded code in advance of the live stream. There is currently a static placeholder image in the player window. Image will be locked 24 hours prior to the event to allow for early site publishing. 

You are welcome to keep your site’s logos and branding around the iframe experience, and the player can be scaled appropriately for your site using CSS or the width and height tags within the iframe code snippet to integrate with your responsive site design.  Important Note: 640x360 is a typical for in-page viewing, but if you chose to change the size of the player, it’s important that you keep a 16x9 aspect ratio! 
On-demand will be available approximately 10 minutes after the live broadcast concludes. No action is required for VoD. The window will automagically change from live to on-demand. 

In the embed code below, please replace `[INSERT_SITE_NAME]` with an identifier for your site. For example, if embedding onto example.com you could use 

`https://mediastream.microsoft.com/events/2019/1904/VirtualLaunchEvent/player/VirtualLaunchEvent.html?cid=synd-EXAMPLE` 

Please contact [vs2019launch@microsoft.com](mailto:vs2019launch@microsoft.com) to let us know you are interested in syndicating the event.   

### Please use the code below for implementation:
 
`<iframe src='https://mediastream.microsoft.com/events/2019/1904/VirtualLaunchEvent/player/VirtualLaunchEvent.html?cid=synd-[INSERT_SITE_NAME]' border='0' frameborder='0' scrolling='no' width='640' height='360' allowfullscreen='true' style='overflow:hidden;'> </iframe>`
